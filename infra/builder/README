== Initial Installation
All compiled binaries go into the "dist" folder.


source env.sh
./build-docker-image.sh
./build-qemu-image.sh
./compile-kernel.sh
./compile-monitor.sh
./compile-nvme-tools.sh
./compile-qemu.sh
./compile-tests.sh

./docker-run-sanity.sh

== Running QEMU
NOTE Every QEMU run uses a fresh copy of the QEMU guest image pre-made by build-qemu-image.sh.
Additionally ALL necessary binaries are copied into the home directory of the guest (Including nvme cli, nvme compliance)

./docker-run-qemu.sh
    - Accessible via ssh @ port 2222 username=esd password=esd
    - Accessible via vnc @ port 5900
    - eVSSIM API @ http port 2003
    - CTRL+C To stop

    - While QEMU is running, the following scripts are available
        ./guest-entry.sh - Enter using SSH into the running QEMU virtual machine (Guest)
        ./docker-entry.sh - Enter into the running QEMU container image (Host)

./docker-run-qemu-enter-guest.sh
    - Same as above but will attach into the guest terminal

.docker-copy-into-guest.sh
    - Copies compiled binaries such nvme cli and nvme compliance into the QEMU image.
    - Note that when running all the commands above this is done IMPLICITLY
    - This can be used explicitly for debugging purposes

== Running docker
./docker-run-bash.sh - Run bash inside an empty docker
./docker-run-bash-chrooted.sh - Run bash inside the image of the QEMU guest

== Tests
./docker-test-host.sh - Host tests
./docker-test-guest.sh - Guest tests using QEMU. Each test is saved into the "dist/tests" unique test folder.

      "message": "How does mount work in test_and_log_all_operations.sh with OTGT without formatting? This line writes the superblock object to the NVMe device. Later, in line 45, mount is called and is expected to read the superblock object from OTGT, which was written to the NVMe device. I\u0027m afraid that the traces generated by test_and_log_all_operations.sh for mount, open, read, write, and close might be misleading. I would expect mount to fail. Let\u0027s check what happened during the mount. Adding formatting for OTGT and comparing mount traces will shed some light.",

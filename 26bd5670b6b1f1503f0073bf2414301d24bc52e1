      "message": "This will probably cause issues with guest tests, which provide the storage strategy as a number. See `simulator/infra/builder/docker-test-guest.sh` and `EVSSIM_RUNTIME_STORAGE_STRATEGY`.\n\nPlease look at my MR: https://review.gerrithub.io/c/davidsaOpenu/simulator/+/1223886\nat `infra/builder/docker-test-guest.sh` line 49. During my testing I\u0027ve found that objects_via_ioctl is erroneously configured with sector strategy (1), when in fact it should be object strategy (2). Due to extra checks I\u0027ve added in `eVSSIM/FTL_SOURCE/PAGE_MAP/ftl_obj_strategy.c`, without properly configuring `EVSSIM_RUNTIME_STORAGE_STRATEGY`, this test will fail.",

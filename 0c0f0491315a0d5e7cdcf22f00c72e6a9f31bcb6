      "message": "I now understand better what\u0027s going on here after working on my branch. This indeed looks better now, but still wrong:\n\n1. Remove the `nsid` parameter in GC_CHECK, GARBAGE_COLLECTION, etc. - it\u0027s completely useless. There used to be additional irrelevant parameters that I\u0027ve removed as well.\n2. You are basically taking the `lpn` from some random `nsid` (the parameter I just asked you to remove), and moving it to a different `page_nsid`. If I understand correctly, `lpn` and `nsid` should be seen as a tight pair that must stay together.",

As you can see, `_FTL_WRITE_SECT` and `_FTL_READ_SECT` are missing the first `device_index` parameter that is relatively new. Therefore, it can be concluded that the changes in this file are untested and probably unnecessary.",

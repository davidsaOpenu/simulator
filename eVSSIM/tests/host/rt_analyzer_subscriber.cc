/**
 * The rt subscriber does a regression test of the real time log analyzer.
 * It consists of three main calls:
 * - subscribe: subscribes to the analyzer given, and saves it.
 * - write: writes an artificial sequence of different logs to the logger associated with the analyzer.
 * - read: checks the output of the analyzer using the handler `analyze_stats`.
 * This test checks that the statistics that the analyzer outputs are valid, and corresponds to
 * the logs written during the `write` function. In addition, it makes sure that if the stats
 * do not change after a log was written to the logger, then the analyzer does not output any
 * stats (in order to reduce the amount of data flowing between the different parts of the
 * logging mechanism).
 * The expected output of the analyzer is stored in the variable `results`, and it is used in the
 * `analyze_stats` hook to compare the expected output and the actual output.

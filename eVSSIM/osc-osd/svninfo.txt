svninfo: START of svn-import branch

This git Repository is an svn checkout of three sub-projects
from the OSC's OSD project:

https://svn.osc.edu/repos/pw/osd/osd-util	at osd-util/
https://svn.osc.edu/repos/pw/osd/osd-target	at osd-target/
https://svn.osc.edu/repos/pw/osd/osd-initiator	at osd-initiator/

This git branch is a machine made Mirror of these svn branches
without any added/removed or edited files. It will start with svn
checkout of revision r695, useing the svn_fetch3.sh script to
git-commit each svn revision, one by one.

The svn_fetch3.sh script used to create this tree is available
in the first commit of this tree.

It is assumed that the proper .gitignore file is manually placed at
the git-root for proper operation of this import

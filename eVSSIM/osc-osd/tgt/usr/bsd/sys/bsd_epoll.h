/*
 * bsd_epoll.h - Linux epoll.h compatible header
 *
 * Signed-off-by: Boaz Harrosh <bharrosh@panasas.com> 2009
 *
 * description:
 *    This file makes any code that was compiled with <sys/epoll.h> header
 *    on Linux compile-able under FreeBSD and derivatives. It is meant to be
 *    used Together with bsd_epoll.c source file, to also be run-able.
 *
 * Example useage:
 *   Any code that was using epoll.h before can now do:
 *	#if defined(__linux__)
 *	#	include <sys/epoll.h>
 *	#else
 *	#	include "bsd_epoll.h"
 *	#endif
 *  Under FreeBSD the Makefile should add the bsd_epoll.c source file
 *
 * License: 
 *      This header file is not under any license it has been long claimed
 *      and legally proven that Interfaces cannot be copyrighted.
 *      Now since this file only defines interfaces originally put forth
 *      by the Linux Kernel, they are not governed by any License.
 *      In anyway, Linus Trovalds, the originator of the Linux Kernel as
 *      Stated that the Linux Kernel's user-mode APIs are not copyrighted.
 *
 *      This file was hand crafted by me based on Linux Kernel sources
 *      and GlibC's header epoll.h to be made code compatible with epoll.h
 *      Header on Linux.
 *
 *      However, the implementation file bsd_epoll.c is copyrighted under
 *      the "New BSD License" so it can be included in the tirpc library
 *      project.
 *      But I fully expect that if you make any fixes/enhancements to
 *      bsd_epoll.c you shall send these changes to me for inclusion
 *      in the next version. (Or I'll hunt your dreams, and you will
 *      not have peace)

arch       - architecture dependent (code, configuration, compilation).
interfaces - defines how different modules communicate.
modules    - each module runs on a dedicated CPU (e.g. garbage collector, accounting manager, lockmanager). Each module is compiled in an architecture dependent way.
config     - everything configuration related (but arch dependent).

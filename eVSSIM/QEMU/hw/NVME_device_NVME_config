Section 1: NVME Space Config File Info
The Configuration file contains the NVME space registers which the QEMU
uses to initialize its NVME space.Note that these values would be read
on initialization as well as on future resets of NVME device.The CFG_NAME
tag defines a unique value that is constant across a set of registers
which fall under the same category.

Following are the CFG_NAME's supported by the parser for NVME space:
CNTRLREG : NVME Controller Registers

The NAME tag indicates the name specific to each register. It should be
noted that, NAME tag can be any general name and does not have to be unique
like CFG_NAME.

The OFFSET tag gives a relative offset of this register in its corresponding
section defined by CFG_NAME. The parser code uses the above offset for
storing the values in the NVME space.

The LENGTH indicates the length in bytes of the resgister defined in
NVME space.

The VALUE tag of the registers is where you set the required values
that the NVME card needs to get initialized with.

The reamaining tags indicate a MASK for the registers if it is Read Only, Read
Write, Read Write Clear or Read write Set.If the mask is set to 1 indicates it
has the corresponding capability. For example if RO_MASK = 0x1 then it
indicates that the last bit in that register has a capability of read only.

Each line in the file needs to be no more than 255 charachters and the CFG_NAME
has a limit of 50 charachters.

Values (VALUE) to be written can be either 8 bits, 16 bits or 32 bits with
the appropriate lengths. If you want to write 64 bit values , divide it
into two 32 bit values and enter in the config file.

Doorbell Registers support has not been added yet ,and is defaulted to 64
Queues in NVME module

Section 2: Parsing Syntax
    The Qemu parser, would only look for values under the <REG> and </REG>.
Thus anything written outside the <REG> and </REG> would be considered as
invalid values. Thus this is a good place for writing down comments.
    There are 10 fields inside the <REG> and </REG> header. If some of the
fields are not applicable to a particular register, then just default it
to 0x00. If by mistake you forget to list down some of the entries
between the headers, the parser would take care of it and default it to
0x00.
    <COMMENT> and </COMMENT> is used if you want the parser to neglect the values.
Moreover anything written outside <REG> and </REG> block is also ignored by
the parser

This library implements functions that help in simulating SSD on a given file.
There is a copy of them in ftl_sect_strategy.c which need them.
The reason for this duplication is that adding new files require chnages in other repositories and it is not worth it.
We leave this directory so we will be able to test the functions with unit test.
The library has unit tests under the directory ./test and a Makefile for compiling them.

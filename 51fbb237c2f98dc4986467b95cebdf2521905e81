Installing binutils-2.26 solves relocation issue but evenually ends in qemu crash and as a consequence no /dev/nvme0n1 is detected by the docker-run-sanity.sh. \n\nThe problem was fixed by  https://review.gerrithub.io/c/davidsaOpenu/qemu/+/537416 \nthat removed the compilation flag that referenced the 32 bit library.\n\nSo just the renaming part of the change makes sence.",
